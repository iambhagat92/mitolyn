## Wake time and light
- Wake at a consistent time when possible; 7–9 hours sleep target.
- Get 5–10 minutes of outdoor light within an hour of waking to anchor circadian rhythm.

## Hydration and electrolytes
- Drink water on waking; add a squeeze of lemon or a pinch of electrolytes if desired.
- Keep a bottle visible to sip through the morning.

## Protein-first breakfast
- Eat within a few hours of waking (or at your preferred schedule) with 25–35g protein: Greek yogurt + whey, eggs + veggies, protein oats.
- Add produce and healthy fats for satiety. Limit liquid sugar.

## Caffeine timing (and how it pairs with supplements)
- If you tolerate caffeine, consider waiting 60–90 minutes after waking to avoid a crash.
- If [PRODUCT_NAME] contains stimulants, space it from coffee to minimize jitters and protect sleep.

## Movement: steps, mobility, and strength primers
- 5–10 minute mobility: neck, shoulders, hips, ankles.
- Walk 10–20 minutes or hit a step burst; aim for 8–10k total steps by day’s end.
- 1–2 strength primers: squats, hinges, push-ups, rows (1–2 sets) to “prime” the body.

## Supplement timing with [PRODUCT_NAME]
- Follow the label. Many prefer earlier dosing to avoid sleep disruption if stimulant-based.
- Pair with breakfast and a short walk; reassess after 3–4 weeks.
- Consult your healthcare provider as needed.

## Stress, journaling, and planning
- 2–5 minutes: jot priorities, steps/strength plan, and a simple menu.
- Brief breathing drill (4–6 slow breaths) to lower stress reactivity.

## Troubleshooting & FAQs
- Not hungry early? Pack a protein snack and eat later; still hit daily protein.
- Too rushed? Do a 5-minute mini: 1 sun exposure + 1 mobility flow + protein plan.
- Coffee jitters? Delay caffeine, reduce dose, or space from [PRODUCT_NAME].
- What if I train at night? Keep morning light/hydration and protein; avoid stimulants late.

## Introduction
If losing weight after 40 feels harder than it used to, you’re not imagining it. Hormonal shifts, gradual muscle loss, and busy schedules can slow metabolism and increase cravings.

We’ll also explain how a supplement like [PRODUCT_NAME] may help with appetite control and energy when used alongside healthy habits. Short on time?

## Why weight loss changes after 40
- **Hormonal shifts and metabolism:** Perimenopause and menopause can influence estrogen and progesterone, affecting fat distribution and fluid balance. Thyroid changes and insulin sensitivity may also shift with age.
- **Muscle mass and NEAT:** We naturally lose lean mass without resistance training. Less muscle typically means a lower resting metabolic rate. Non-exercise movement (walking, fidgeting, chores) often declines with busy lifestyles.
- **Sleep, stress, and cravings:** Poor sleep elevates hunger hormones and reduces willpower; chronic stress can increase appetite and preference for calorie-dense foods.

## Benefits of a metabolic-support approach
- **Appetite control →** Better adherence to a calorie-appropriate plan.
- **Stable energy →** More steps, more consistency.
- **Consistency > intensity →** Sustainable habits outperform crash diets.
